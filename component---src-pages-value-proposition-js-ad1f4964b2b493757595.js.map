Align your company.</h2>\n          <p>\n            Modus Planning enables interdepartmental collaboration. Operations, supply chain, marketing, and finance operating from the same source of truth.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n             No repeat work, no miscommunication, no wasted time.

Organize your data.</h2>\n          <p>\n            Demand forecasts, trade promotion planning, customer orders, and consumption data used to be housed in different places. Modus puts all your relevant information in a centralized platform, so no metrics are overlooked. \n          </p>\n\n          <h2>3. Upgrade from your outdated processes.</h2>\n          <p>\n            Most growing brands rely heavily on spreadsheets.

Eliminate waste.</h2>\n          <p>\n            Brands are billed by retailers for spoilage or “reclaim”.

Avoid missed upside.</h2>\n          <p>\n            Accurate forecasts ensure there is enough product on shelf to prevent stock-outs.

Take control of your supply chain.\n          </h2>\n          <p>\n            No one knows your demand better than you. Modus allows its users to compare distributor customer orders to internally generated forecasts to ensure your distributors are ordering correctly, and not over-indexing during an OI period.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Modus syncs with DC inventory data to help its users track their product down the supply chain.
