Align Your Company</h2>\n          <p>\n            Modus Planning enables interdepartmental collaboration. Operations, supply chain, marketing, and finance operating from the same source of truth.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n             No repeat work, no miscommunication, no wasted time. Modus enables its users to maximize their most valuable resource: time.\n          </p>\n\n          <h2>2. Organize your data.</h2>\n          <p>\n            Demand forecasts, trade promotion planning, customer orders, and consumption data used to be housed in different places. Modus puts all your relevant information in a centralized platform, so no metrics are overlooked. \n          </p>\n\n          <h2>3. Upgrade from your outdated processes.</h2>\n          <p>\n            Most growing brands rely heavily on spreadsheets. Unfortunately, spreadsheets are prone to errors, do not scale, and limit collaboration – all of which could be costly for growing brands. Modus allows brands to retire their spreadsheets, once and for all.\n          </p>\n\n          <h2>\n            4. Deeply understand how your business’ performance is evolving.\n          </h2>\n          <p>\n            Modus Planning compares your shipments and scan data vs. the forecast by consignee, so you can consistently track over or under performing customers or products. \n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Track gross and net sales to understand margins and slotting investment ROIs.\n          </p>\n\n          <h2>5. Never Stop Evolving.</h2>\n          <p>\n            Much of the business planning within CPG is educated guesswork. With Modus Planning, all relevant data is tracked to enable repeat success and knowledge-gaining from mistakes, meaning forecasts, lift percentages, and customer orders all improve the longer a brand uses Modus. \n          </p>\n          <p>\n            As you evolve Modus Planning is too, always incorporating best practices and new helpful features along the way.\n          </p>\n\n          <h2>6. Forecast Accurately.</h2>\n          <p>\n            Accurate demand forecasts inform the production plan, can help project future growth, and assist with company-wide strategic decision making. Modus Planning has been proven to significantly improve forecast accuracy for its users.\n          </p>\n\n          <h2>7. Eliminate Waste.</h2>\n          <p>\n            Brands are billed by retailers for spoilage or “reclaim.” Accurate forecasts eliminate this costly expense, which means more money in to drive sales, and importantly, less wasted food.\n          </p>\n\n          <h2>8. Avoid Missed Upside.</h2>\n          <p>\n            Accurate forecasts ensure there is enough product on shelf to prevents stock-outs. Without Modus, the opportunity cost of a poor forecast, leading to poor orders could be devastating during a major promotion.\n          </p>\n\n          <h2>9.

Track the effectiveness and make sure you never overshoot your promotion budget.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Calculate the optimal outcomes based on user-defined promotion constraints. Maximize every dollar spent on trade based upon your brand’s unique circumstances.\n          </p>\n\n          <h2>\n            10. Manage your supply chain so you do not get taken advantage of.\n          </h2>\n          <p>\n            No one knows your demand better than you. Modus allows its users to compare distributor customer orders to internally generated forecasts to ensure your distributors are ordering correctly, and not over-indexing during an OI period.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Modus syncs with DC inventory data to help its users track their product down the supply chain. Oversee customer DC inventory days-on-hand and implement strategies to eliminate spoilage or stockouts downstream based on projected forecasts.\n          </p>\n\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </Layout>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default ValuePropositionPage\n\nexport const pageQuery = graphql`\n  query {\n    site {\n      siteMetadata {\n        title\n      }\n    }\n  }\n`\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
