            <h4>
              Our mission is to provide the tools consumer packaged goods (CPG) companies need to masterfully plan and execute their business.
            </h4>
            <h4>
              OnePage Software's applications are created by CPG people for CPG people. We strive to develop products that are massively impactful, while being easy to afford, and even easier to learn.
            </h4>
            <h4>
              This philosophy guides our approach to every client relationship. We desire to create long-lasting, robust partnerships where community feedback allows us to optimize and refine our products to drive the most value possible.

                  There, Ryan led the S&OP/Demand Planning process for Popsicle and Ben & Jerry's before taking the leap and going to the then four-person startup, Icelandic Provisions.

                  Ryan quickly realized that the dire need for a cloud-based bottom-up planning system extended throughout the CPG world. Seeing this, Ryan and Miles have spent the past five years working closely with rapidly growing brands to create Modus Planning into the best-in-class system it is today.
