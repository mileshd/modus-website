                  With majors in Supply Chain and Information Systems, at the University of Maryland (just like Miles), Ryan went the supply chain route and joined the select Unilever's Future Leader Program.

                <p>
                  There, Ryan led the S&OP/Demand Planning process for Popsicle and Ben & Jerry's, before taking the leap and going to the then four-person startup, Icelandic Provisions. Through Ryan's tenure, Icelandic Provisions has been consistently recognized as one of the fastest growing brands in the dairy yogurt category nation-wide.

                <p>
                  Ryan quickly realized that the dire need for a cloud-based bottoms-up planning system like Modus Planning extended throughout the CPG world. Seeing this, Ryan and Miles have spent the past five years working closely with rapidly growing brands to refine Modus Planning into the best-in-class system it is today.

                <p>
                  Today, Modus Planning is the central planning operating system of high-performing, high-growth brands across the supermarket. Ryan leads the onboarding, training, and implementation efforts along with high-level business strategy.
